## The Idea (*please make it better*)

We all love watching foreign-language movies with subtitles in our native language. But what about real life? Introducing: subtitles for people. It's a shirt with a screen integrated into it that displays live translations of your speech.

As a bonus, it'll make your speech more clear for everyone, and accessible for those who couldn't hear or understand your language otherwise.
